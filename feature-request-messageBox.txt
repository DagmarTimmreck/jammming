Feature Request: Message Box
September 25th 2017

OBJECTIVE
To provide a means to display messages to the user.

BACKGROUND
Currently there is no way to give feedback to the user whether an action she triggered was completed sucessfully or not.
For a good user experience it is key that the user knows the outcome of her actions.

This feature accomplishes the following:
- displays a message to the user
- is located above the SearchBar
- is hidden if there is no message

TECHNICAL DESIGN
A new component, MessageBox, should be created.
Should look like this: (Screenshot: Success/Failure)

To put this Component to use functions that trigger actions on spotify
have to be updated to wait for a message to be displayed and display that.

Methods of Spotify.js have to return messages.
Work on Error handling in Spotify.js
