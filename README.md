***Jammming - CodeCademy Pro Intensive project***

*Notes to the reviewer:*
- I built the React part of the project without the given instructions. (Only consulted them to find out where to place state after running into issues with my own approach)
- I used TDD as descirbed in [Getting Started with TDD in React](https://semaphoreci.com/community/tutorials/getting-started-with-tdd-in-react)
- I used eslint with the airbnb presets (only exception: I ignored that console.log is unwanted for now)
- For the API requests I did consult the instructions and for the last steps of saving the playlist to spotify I got the source code.
- I already refactored a little for better readability
- In 'todos-and-ideas' I have a loose track of open issues **I would love to have your opinion on those** Are they necessary or nice-to-haves?

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

Replaced test environment with mocha/chai/enzyme

Configured eslint to use airbnb style guide and to work with atom
